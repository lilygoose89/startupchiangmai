If you're looking for a place to host your next event, whether that's a small talk or meetup or even a full-blown party, here are a couple venues you might consider.

The best way to get in touch with a manager at one of these venues is probably via Facebook messenger or LINE, but there's nothing like a face to face meeting to make a great impression. Keep in mind that when you're hosting an event at one of these spaces you're representing the space, the team, and asking them to put in extra work as well, so establishing a good rapport and direct line of communication will go a long way.

Been to events at these spaces? What did you think? What other some other great spaces you've attended events at? Comments and additional suggestions are highly welcomed!
