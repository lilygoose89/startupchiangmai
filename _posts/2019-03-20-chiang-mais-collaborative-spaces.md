Chiang Mai's many co-working spaces and outlet-rich cafes is undoubtedly one of the reasons the city is so popular with digital nomads. These hubs provide the three amenities that any entrepreneur or digital professional needs to succeed: lightning fast wifi, bottomless caffeine, and, most importantly, talented people to mingle with and learn from.

Coworking spaces are so much more than just jumped up coffee shops or shared offices for the untethered. They're collaborative hubs that bring together talent and ideas, two things every startup ecosystem needs to grow.

Outside of the digital realm, however, Chiang Mai is also seeing a growing number of collaborative spaces that cater to the needs of other entrepreneurial classes. By providing amenities and resources that might typically be beyond the budget of a bootstrapping entrepreneur, these shared spaces support the growth of diverse new businesses.


## Makerspace Thailand

First on the list, if you don't already know Makerspace Thailand, then you might be acquainted with one of their successful spin-off ventures, the [Air Tricorder](https://airtricorder.com/). Located next to Punspace Coworking's Tha Pae location, this collaborative workshop comes equipped with all that the modern inventor needs.

With 3D printers, CNC machines, laser cutters, a fully stocked workshop of power tools, and more, this is a coworking space that encourages you to bring your creativity to life. Founder [Nati Sang](https://www.chiangmaicitylife.com/citylife-articles/makerspace-the-future-will-be-open-source/) is a former Silicon Valley IT professional who aims to support what he believes is an inherent strength of Thai creatives, the ability to work with their hands. For that reason, his member subscriptions are accessibly priced and the space fosters connections between local Thai and international talent.

If you're a newbie looking to learn about tooling and manufacturing, the Makerspace team are happy to show you the ropes, from how to design CAD drawings to mastering 3D printing or going to town with a table saw. Need to refine your prototype before launching a Kickstarter campaign? This is the place to do it in case, you know, you didn't bring your whole toolshed with you when you decided to move to Thailand to pursue your dreams.
