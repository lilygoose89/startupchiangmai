We may sometimes think of startups as pulling themselves up by their bootstraps, but few things in this world are created in a vacuum. When it comes to providing essential resources like talent and capital, governments play a big role in making these available and massively affect the success or failure of a startup ecosystem.

In an emerging tech scene like Thailand, a lot of support for entrepreneurship and innovation comes from the top-down, and while [I may have said a stern word or two](https://beachcity.com.au/build-entrepreneurial-ecosystem.html){: target="_blank"} about the effectiveness of this approach alone, there's no denying it's an essential component.

Read on to learn about the Thai government's digital, innovation, and economic development agencies and the role they play in Chiang Mai's startup ecosystem.

## [National Innovation Agency (NIA)](https://www.nia.or.th/){: target="_blank"}

Empowering Thailand's innovation, the National Innovation Agency (NIA) has a mandate to improve Thailand's competitiveness and promote economic restructuring. Operating under the&nbsp;

"NIA functions as the key engine driving national innovation by co-creation, networking, fostering, and partnering different organizations from various fields such as academic, technology, industry, finance and investment. Its main focus is on utilizing knowledge management to achieve innovation, particularly to foster “innovation on cluster platform” which uses innovation as the principal tool in improving quality of life and driving towards an increasing competitive economy. "

While the work they do ranges from connecting academic researchers with corporate partners to providing startup grants, NIA's primary driver is developing strategic partnerships. By facilitating these linkages, great ideas receive the funding needed to kick things up to the next level and emerging technology has a better chance to reach the market.

A national body, their logo will be found on all manner of startup event banners but much of their work is also conducted via sub-agencies under their umbrella.

## [Startup Thailand](https://www.startupthailand.org/en/home/){: target="_blank"}

One of the most visible public bodies, the aptly named Startup Thailand, are responsible for producing most of the events and media related to Thailand's startup and innovation space.

"Founded as a national agency to support the startup businesses and its ecosystem based on the policy of the National Startup Committee (NSC), Startup Thailand operates under the Ministry of Science and Technology in collaboration with related organizations, helping startups to utilize local resources for their product and service development, and local employment and revenue distribution, leading to new target industries in driving the country forward."

Headquartered in True Digital Park, Thailand's (and quite possibly the world's) largest startup campus, I was lucky enough to cover Startup Thailand's annual marquee event, Startup Nation. With a stated aim to make Thailand a global startup destination, there is clear investment in broadcasting to the world that the country is open for business.

Startup Thailand also produce a magazine, videos and other resources aimed at educating startups and sharing ecosystem stories, primarily for Thai-language audiences.
