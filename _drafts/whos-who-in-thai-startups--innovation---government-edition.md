We may sometimes think of startups as pulling themselves up by their bootstraps, but few things in this world are created in a vacuum. When it comes to providing essential resources like talent and capital, governments play a big role in making these available and massively affect the success or failure of a startup ecosystem.

In an emerging tech scene like Thailand, a lot of support for entrepreneurship and innovation comes from the top-down, and while [I may have said a stern word or two](https://beachcity.com.au/build-entrepreneurial-ecosystem.html){: target="_blank"} about the effectiveness of this approach alone, there's no denying it's an essential component.
