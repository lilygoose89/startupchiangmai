How do you make great software? Without writing a textbook about it, you can boil this down to two things: great ideas, and badass developers. A healthy startup ecosystem should have heaps of both, and smart companies know that the way to find and support these is by bringing together the best and brightest to share and connect.

While the web offers many tools for tech nerds to do this while comfortably hidden behind their laptops, a city like Chiang Mai also offers great opportunities for software enthusiasts to come together IRL (or *in real life* for those not fluent in geek speak).

With so many passionate creatives and entrepreneurs, the city never has any shortage of meetups and workshops and some of the best are led by Chiang Mai's community-minded software companies.
