## ThinkNET

The team behind the Chiang Mai Developer Meetups, ThinkNET is a software workshop with a big emphasis on company culture. Founded in Bangkok, the team that set up shop here in Chiang Mai were more than happy to ditch the rate-race commuter grind of the big city to embrace Chiang Mai's more laidback lifestyle. Just because they enjoy work-life balance doesn't mean they lack ambition though, they're a talented team creating cutting edge products with some of the most exciting new tech.

ThinkNET go all out with the Chiang Mai Develop Meetups, organizing more than two-hours worth of workshops and presentations on everything from the newest open-source tools for software architects, to how teams can learn through design thinking or pair programming. Run primarily in Thai (though half the powerpoints are done entirely in English) the event is open to developers of all backgrounds as well as those who are looking to dip their feet into programming.
