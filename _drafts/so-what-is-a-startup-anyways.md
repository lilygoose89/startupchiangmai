I've been in the startup world now since about 2014. During this time, my life has been all about tech and software, finding product-market fit, automating shit, creating pitch decks, and figuring out how to scale. I'm surrounded by developers and hardcore nerds and a lot, a lot of jargon.&nbsp; It has dawned on me that I've been in a bit of a bubble and the things which are so obvious to me are, well, obviously not so obvious to others.

When I started reaching out to my network and telling people I was building a directory for startups, the question immediately emerged - what exactly do you mean by startup?

It's so clear in my mind, but when I step back and look at the larger startups world in general and what the so-called experts on Forbes have to say, it's clear that even within our bubble, we're not in agreement.

Is it any business in an early-stage? Is it a company backed by venture capital? Is it only software or tech businesses? Is it just a lame blanket term for a do-nothing project run by overgrown adolescents in tshirts and hoodies?\!?

So for the record I want to clarify two things. 1) the first is my own (working) definition of what a startup is and 2) I want to clarify the purpose of this project, startupchiangmai.com.

## So What the F\*\*\* is a Startup?

**A startup is a company in the early stages of development or growth which has a tremendous potential to scale or disrupt a traditional way of doing things.**

That's my definition for the purposes of this website and directory.

It a definition I've arrived at through a lot of reading and thought and asking others for feedback and checking my assumptions and revising and finally deciding that I don't actually care what other people think too much and my definition is better.

Go ask [Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/start-up){: target="_blank"}, [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/startup.asp){: target="_blank"}, [Startup.com](https://www.startups.com/library/expert-advice/what-is-a-startup-company){: target="_blank"} or [Eric Reis](https://www.amazon.com/Lean-Startup-Entrepreneurs-Continuous-Innovation/dp/0307887898){: target="_blank"} and they'll all give you a different answer, and there's sensible reasons for that. Startups and entrepreneurship have gained a lot of hype in recent years, and when anything becomes part of the popular culture, it takes on a new life and meanings get broadened and adjusted according to the needs of different groups.

My two-cents is that this has led to an overuse of the term and a broadening of its meaning that is actually not very helpful. Sometimes people want to be kind and generous, but sometimes what serves a purpose best is boundaries, and I'm drawing a line.

Specifically, I'm drawing the line against calling any type of fledgling business a startup. This drives me **insane**.

The playbook for entrepreneurship applies to many types of business, but that's also true of management and we don't seem to have the same pretension for calling every small business manager an executive.

The process for growing a small business versus a startup are not the same. The typical investment and growth strategy is not the same. The capacity to scale is not the same. The metrics for success and the paths to scale are not the same.

The key difference here is in the scale and the metrics for success. The challenges and opportunities are not the same, thus the playbooks are different. It doesn't help, it actuall y harms to be too broad.

I love you honey but your restaurant/guesthouse/agency/lifestyle blog/e-commerce store&nbsp;**IS NOT A STARTUP**. It's probably just a small business.

## Oh, So You Hate Small Businesses or Something?

I do not have anything against small businesses. I think small businesses are fantastic\! I think, on the whole, small business do more to create wealth, purpose, and human happiness than startups do.

I think one of the reasons that they *are* so great is precisely because they're small, they're more focused and they can deliver genuine value. I love my favorite bar more passionately than I do my favorite software.&nbsp;

## What Do Startups Do?

## What Are Some Examples of Startups?

..

## Ok, Well What's the Point of StartupChiangMai.com?

That's a great question\! Thanks for asking hypothetical reason I have created for the purpose of my own editorial.

While I have strong opinions about what type of business qualifies as a startup, I intend for this space to support entrepreneurship of all sorts, not just startups.&nbsp;

Confusing I know, but until this project becomes a business big enough to require a board or serious editorial oversight, I'm going to do what works best for me.
