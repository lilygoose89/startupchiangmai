I've been in the startup world now since about 2014. During this time, my life has been all about tech and software, finding-product market fit, building processes,&nbsp; creating pitch decks and figuring out how to scale. I'm surrounded by developers and hardcore nerds and a lot, a lot of jargon. I'm coming to realize I've been in a bit of a bubble and the things which are so obvious to me are, well, obviously not so obvious to others.

When I started reaching out to my network and telling people I was building a directory for startups, the question immediately emerged - what exactly do you mean by startup?

It's so clear in my mind, but when I step back and look at the larger startups world in general or what the so-called experts on Forbes have to say, it's clear that even within our bubble, we're not in agreement.

Is it any business in an early-stage? Is it a company backed by venture capital? Is it only software or tech businesses? Is it just a lame blanket term for a do-nothing project run by overgrown adolescents in tshirts and hoodies?

So for the record I want to clarify two things. 1) the first is my own (working) definition of what a startup is and 2) I want to clarify the purpose of this project, startupchiangmai.com.

So What the F\*\*\* is a Startup?

For the purposes of this directory&nbsp;

What's the Point of StartupChiangMai.com?
