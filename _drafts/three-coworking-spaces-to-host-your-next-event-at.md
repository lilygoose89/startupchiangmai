By day a cafe and great place to work, by night, a swanky party venue. Some of Chiang Mai's best coworking spaces might surprise you with the transformations they make when the sun goes down.

The best way to get in touch with a manager is probably via Facebook messenger or LINE if they've made their ID available, but there's nothing like a face to face meeting to make a great impression. Keep in mind that when you're hosting an event at one of these spaces you're representing the venue and asking them to put in extra work as well, so establishing a good rapport and direct line of communication will go a long way.

Been to events at these spaces? What did you think? What other some other great spaces you've attended events at? Comments and additional suggestions are highly welcomed!
