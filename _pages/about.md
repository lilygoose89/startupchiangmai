#### Shining a spotlight on Chiang Mai's Startups and Entrepreneurs

Startup Chiang Mai is an effort to give Chiang Mai's most ambitious startups and creative entrepreneurs greater visibility. By bringing the conversation online, we're shouting out their message to a larger audience and inviting the world to discover the best the city has to offer.

#### Building a Healthy Business Ecosystem

Our mission is to build Chiang Mai's most comprehensive digital directory for all things startup and entrepreneurship. Through our company listings, we're fostering connections and encouraging the flow of information and talent that will help this ecosystem to grow and thrive.

#### What's So Special About Chiang Mai?

At first glance, it might seem a stretch to name Chiang Mai the Silicon Valley of Thailand. With its ancient temples and _sabai sabai_ pace of life, you'd be forgiven for thinking that Thailand's second city is purely a lifestyle destination.

Dig a little deeper into the fabric of the city though and you'll discover Chiang Mai is overflowing with creative energy and perched on the brink of a tech revolution.

We've got scrappy startups and ambitious software agencies, experienced technologists, feisty innovators and a new generation taking advantage of online opportunities to pursue their dreams. Digital nomads ditching their desks in favor of flexible work also flock to the city in droves, and they're bringing world-class talent and experience in creating ventures on a global scale.


Offline, Chiang Mai's brick and mortars are also worth shouting about. More than just money-making ventures, we're seeing a growing class of passionate entrepreneurs building businesses with intention and social impact. They're celebrating culture and heritage, they're bringing together communities, and they're the living hearts of our city.
