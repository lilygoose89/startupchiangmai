<div style="background: #fe5f55; padding: 5%; margin-bottom: 2%;"><p style="color: white; font-size: 2em; line-height: 1.2em;">How many startups are there in Chiang Mai?</p></div>

#### &nbsp;

No one seems to know how many startups there are in Chiang Mai, much less how many of those are investable businesses. Are these startups only Thai-focused or do they have global potential? Are there any ventures founded by the city's huge community of digital nomads that are worth knowing about?

The questions abound, but the answers are hard to find (especially in English).

## Shining a Spotlight on Chiang Mai

Startup Chiang Mai is an attempt to improve visibility into Chiang Mai's local tech, entrepreneurship and startup ecosystem.

By building a directory of all the startups in Chiang Mai this project aims to provide insight into the local ecosystem and kickstart connections and opportunities.
