    "body": "Startup Chiang Mai is an effort to shine a light on the startups and entrepreneurs of Chiang MaiWe know they’re out there, so why don’t we all know about them? Maybe it’s because this scrappy crew has more talent than confidence, but we’re not really satisfied to let them hide, tinkering away at their projects. This is a city full of creative people on the brink of a tech revolution, it’s high time these hardworking guys and gals get some recognition. On this website, you will find a directory of information to help you connect with the people you need to move your project forward. You will also find behind-the-scenes stories and get to know the people shaping the startup story of Chiang Mai. We believe it should be easy to find people and information, and access resources and expertise. Why work alone?: Don’t you want to learn new skills? Meet the right people to move your project forward? Connect with new talent and find investors? If we each go it alone, it’s an uphill battle. By sharing knowledge and references we help each other build pathways to success. We believe a rising tide lifts all, and by connecting talented individuals and building a community, we will be able to take a huge collective step forward in developing the startup ecosystem of Chiang Mai, and of Thailand. What will the future bring?: When we tell people we think this quiet, temple-filled city is the next Silicon Valley of Thailand, the typical response is a laugh or a cocked eyebrow. “Why?” they ask. We ask, “WHY NOT?!” While Chiang Mai is more hyped for lifestyle than hustle, it’s a city that manages to bring together an incredibly diverse set of people and skills. We believe this is an asset. This is a city full of thought-leaders, and a conscious class that wants to do more than create the next CandyCrush. What can a city full of passionate people do with somebody shouting their support from the rooftops? You tell us. Better yet, SHOW US. "

    "body": "2019/03/20 - Chiang Mai’s many co-working spaces and outlet-rich cafes is undoubtedly one of the reasons the city is so popular with digital nomads. These hubs provide the three amenities that any entrepreneur or digital professional needs to succeed: lightning fast wifi, bottomless caffeine, and, most importantly, talented people to mingle with and learn from. Coworking spaces are so much more than just jumped up coffee shops or shared offices for the untethered. They’re collaborative hubs that bring together talent and ideas, two things every startup ecosystem needs to grow. Outside of the digital realm, however, Chiang Mai is also seeing a growing number of collaborative spaces that cater to the needs of other entrepreneurial classes. By providing amenities and resources that might typically be beyond the budget of a bootstrapping entrepreneur, these shared spaces support the growth of diverse new businesses. Makerspace Thailand: First on the list, if you don’t already know Makerspace Thailand, then you might be acquainted with one of their successful spin-off ventures, the Air Tricorder. Located next to Punspace Coworking’s Tha Pae location, this collaborative workshop comes equipped with all that the modern inventor needs. With 3D printers, CNC machines, laser cutters, a fully stocked workshop of power tools, and more, this is a coworking space that encourages you to bring your creativity to life. Founder Nati Sang is a former Silicon Valley IT professional who aims to support what he believes is an inherent strength of Thai creatives, the ability to work with their hands. For that reason, his member subscriptions are accessibly priced and the space fosters connections between local Thai and international talent. If you’re a newbie looking to learn about tooling and manufacturing, the Makerspace team are happy to show you the ropes, from how to design CAD drawings to mastering 3D printing or going to town with a table saw. Need to refine your prototype before launching a Kickstarter campaign? This is the place to do it in case, you know, you didn’t bring your whole toolshed with you when you decided to move to Thailand to pursue your dreams.  Location: 7 Rachadamnoen Road Soi 4, T.
