<p>We know they’re out there, so why don’t we all know about them? We think it’s because this scrappy crew may have more talent than confidence. Well, we’re not really satisfied to let them hide, tinkering away at their projects. This is a city full of creative people on the brink of a tech revolution, it’s high time these hardworking guys and gals get some recognition.</p>

<p>On this website, you will find a directory of information to help you connect with the people you need to move your project forward. You will also find behind-the-scenes stories and get to know the people shaping the startup story of Chiang Mai.</p>

<h2 id="why-work-alone">Why work alone?</h2>

<p>Don’t you want to learn new skills? Meet the right people to move your project forward? Connect with new talent and find investors? If we each go it alone, it’s an uphill battle. By sharing knowledge and references we help each other build pathways to success.</p>

<p>We believe a rising tide lifts all, and by connecting talented individuals and building a community, we will be able to take a huge collective step forward in developing the startup ecosystem of Chiang Mai, and of Thailand.</p>

<h2 id="what-will-the-future-bring">What will the future bring?</h2>

<p>When we tell people we think this quiet, temple-filled city is the next Silicon Valley of Thailand, the typical response is a laugh or a cocked eyebrow. “Why?” they ask. We ask, “WHY NOT?!”</p>

<p>While Chiang Mais more hyped for lifestyle than hustle, it’s a city that manages to bring together an incredibly diverse set of people and skills. We believe this is an asset. This is a city full of thought-leaders, and a conscious class that wants to do more than create the next CandyCrush.</p>

<p>What can a city full of passionate people do with the right kind of voice and backing? You tell us. Better yet, SHOW US.</p>
